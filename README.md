# x9
X-9 is a brazilian slang for "informer".

A X-9 person is motivated by envy.

This X-9 was motivated by keep learning golang.

It is a tool that alerts in Slack missbehavior of AWS instances.

A missbehavior is when an instance runs for short time (check the option TOLERANCE).

It is most usefull to monitor auto scaling groups (ASG). When an instance is member of a ASG the ASG name is used as its key.

It also provides an easy API that anwsers easy questions we are tired to give everyday, like:


* What are the instances running right now, by tags, regions ?
* How many instances we created in the last 24 hours ?
* How many spot instances we created today ?
* How many instances run for less than an hour ?
* How many spot instances run for less than an hour today ?
* How many instances we run by region ?
* How many instaces are run with a certain tag (for example by environment)?
* How many instances by type ?
* What are the missbehaving auto scaling groups right now ?

(check /api for a complete list)

# How does it work ?

Simply by getting the result of "describe instances" and sumarizes it in redis.
The data expires in 24 hours.

# Tags

A rudimentary tag support is provide in this first release. You must use the tags bellow.
If don't use tags or different tags, don't worry, they will be show as "none".

 |Tag|Description|
 |---|---|
 |Env|Environment, ie: QA, DEV, STG, PROD|
 |Product|System|
 |App|Component of System|
